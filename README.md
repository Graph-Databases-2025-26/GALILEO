## üéØ Project Description
We are a student group exploring how **Large Language Models (LLMs)** can collaborate with **databases**.  
Our focus is on **GALOIS**, a framework that integrates LLMs into query execution pipelines.

**Objective:**
- Understand how this approach can improve **data retrieval**.  
- Analyze its **strengths and limitations**.  
- Implement a **practical use case** to demonstrate and test these ideas.

## Structure of the Repository

**The Repository is organized by functional scopes, mirroring the development phases and the required Tasks.**

**The goal is to clearly separate the setup, the baselines, the core system, and the verification tools.**

### Main Files

| File/Folder | Description                                                                                                                     |
