The query joins the 'usa_city' table from the 'target' schema with the 'usa_state' table, matching cities with their respective state capitals. The WHERE clause filters the results to include only those cities with a population less than 150,000.\n\nThe natural language prompt should convey the same intent, asking for the capitals of states with a population condition on their respective cities.\n\nThe response is: \"What are the capitals of states in the USA that have a population of less than 150,00",
