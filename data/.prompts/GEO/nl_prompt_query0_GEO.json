The natural language prompt should reflect this information. The state name is specified as 'new mexico', which is a common misspelling of the actual state name 'New Mexico'. However, since the context is clear, the prompt can still accurately reflect the query's intent.\n\n[Response]\nWhat is the area in square miles of the state of New Mexico?",
