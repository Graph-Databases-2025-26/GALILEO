The query selects the 'name' column from the 'world_presidents' table in the 'target' schema, filtering for rows where the 'country' is 'United States' and the 'party' is 'Whig'. The results are then ordered by the 'end_year' in descending order and limited to the first row, ensuring that the latest Whig president is returned. The natural language prompt should reflect this intent, asking for the name of the last Whig president of the United States.",
